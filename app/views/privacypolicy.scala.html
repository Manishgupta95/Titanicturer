It is possible that Company collectively with its member group companies, or any combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you should expect that the Company would share some or all of your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information with third parties in order to continue to provide the Service. You will receive notice of such event (to the extent that it occurs).
                            <br/>

Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information would be completely removed from our databases in response to your request for suspension or termination of the Services.
                            <br/><br/><b>10.    SECURITY</b>
